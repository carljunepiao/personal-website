"The one whom God sent speaks the words of God"The Savior's command, "Search the Scriptures" (Jn 5,39) shows how profitable they are for us. So search them, and hold fast to what they say with great exactitude and faith. Then, when the divine Scriptures have given you an accurate knowledge of God's will, you will be able to distinguish without error between good and eviL and will not listen to every spirit, or be carried away by harmful thoughts.
You may be certain, my brothers, that nothing is so conducive to our salvation as following the divine commandments of the Savior. Nevertheless we shall...  need great fear, great patience, and constant prayer before the import of even a word of the Master can be revealed to us. Only then shall we perceive the great mystery hidden in short sayings, and be ready to die for the smallest detail of the commandments of God (cf.Mt 5,18). 
For the word of God is like a two-edged sword (Heb 4,12), cutting off and separating the soul from all bodily desire and sensation. More than that, it is like a blazing fire (Jer 20,9), because it stirs up zeal in our souls, and makes us disregard all the sorrows of life, consider every trial we encounter a joy (Jas 1,2), and desire and embrace death, so fearful to others, as life and the means of attaining life.
